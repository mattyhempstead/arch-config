# Workspaces
Bottom of page talks about way to get list of workspaces
https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/Module:-i3

Returns a json of workspaces
$ i3-msg -t get_workspaces
$ man i3-msg

Could us this to write a custom script which looks at which applications are on which workspaces. 
Then have custom icons depending on the application on workspaces.
Maybe use negative offset to get the icon displaying just below it.
